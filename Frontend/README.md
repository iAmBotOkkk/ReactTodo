# React 

Usually people used to make dynamic applications using Dom manipulation 
back then and due to that developers had to write very long codes, There 
were frame-works like Jquery which was popular somewhere around 2013-14. 
But then React came into picture which make developers life very easy,
React became very popular,It is a library for web and native user inter-
faces. 

# ReactTodo

I learned about how React actually works under the hood and try to replicate
a Todo application using react.The main purpose of making a todo application
is to learn how actually state and components works and also how rerendering
happens in React.This project gave me an idea to write the syntax of React.
